# ML-model-Adaboost
I learned how to use AdaBoost, a powerful boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong classifier. AdaBoost is useful because it sequentially trains weak models, typically decision trees, and adjusts their weights based on the errors of the previous models. This approach focuses on the difficult-to-predict instances, improving overall model accuracy and robustness. AdaBoost is particularly effective in reducing bias and variance, making it suitable for various classification tasks. Its ability to enhance weak models and provide high accuracy with less overfitting makes it a valuable tool in machine learning.
