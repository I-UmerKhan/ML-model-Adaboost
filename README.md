# ML-model-Adaboost
I learned how to use AdaBoost, a powerful boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong classifier. AdaBoost is useful because it sequentially trains weak models, typically decision trees, and adjusts their weights based on the errors of the previous models.
